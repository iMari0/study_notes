CHI SQUARE FOR AB TEST

Example:
         Group A | Group B
Clicked      25     20
Non Clicked  75     100
Totals       100    120

We have to test groups and we collect evidence:
    - clicks
    - non clicks
    - all sessions

Null Hypothesis --> There is no significant difference between the 2 groups (A = B)
Alternative Hypothesis --> There is significant difference between the 2 groups (A != B)

Assuming that the null hypothesis (H0) is true, what would be the expected values given the totals.
This means that we are assuming that the results of the two groups are coming from the same distribution.
Hence, we can sum all clicks, non clicked and sessions.

         Group A | Group B | H0
Clicked      25     20       45
Non Clicked  75     100      175
Totals       100    120      220

If H0 is true, then we won't see any difference between group A and H0 and between group B and H0.


What can we expect to see if each of these behaviours were drawn from the same sample?
    - expected clicks a = (45/220) * 100
    - expected clicks b = (45/220) * 120
    - expected non_clicks a = (175/220) * 100
    - expected non_clicks a = (175/220) * 100

Xsquared = sum(observed - expected)**2/ expected
(20 - 24.5)**2/24.5 + (25 - 20.5)**2/20.5 + (100-95.5)**2/95.5 + (75 - 79.5)**2/79.5 = 0.11

Interpretation:
There is 11% chance that the observed values of the 2 groups are coming from the same distribution.
The odds of seeing the observed behaviour and the null hypothesis being true is slightly more than 10%
This rate is too high.
This means that we are 81% confident that there is a significant difference between the 2 groups. We set a confindence level of 95%. Hence we fail to reject H0.

Looking at the table at 0.05 and DF 1 --> 3.84

In this case we don't have enough data to make a final call out. Considering that we have a trend we can collect more data to see a difference.
